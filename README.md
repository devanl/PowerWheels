# PowerWheels
soft-start H-Bridge controller

Arduino Project which allowed for a power-wheels to be retrofitted with a soft-start motor controller to prevent kids from whiplash.  The existing system HW signals were analyzed and reverse engineered to determine appropriate function-blocks.  From there functions were individually analyzed for input/output requirements with truth matrix and pseudo-code development.
